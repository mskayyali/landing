## Presence Tracker, macOS App

Presence is a macOS menu bar application designed to enhance your awareness of the passing time. Unlike traditional productivity tools, Presence takes a different approach: it doesn’t enforce rigid breaks or focus sessions, instead offering a gentle and flexible way to stay mindful of your time.

Features:
- Subtle Time Awareness: Presence provides a quiet reminder of the passage of time, helping you stay conscious of how you're spending your day.
- Non-Intrusive Design: No timers or alarms—Presence lets you decide when to take breaks, promoting a more natural flow.
- Menu Bar Integration: Always visible, Presence sits comfortably in your macOS menu bar, keeping your sense of time right where you need it.
