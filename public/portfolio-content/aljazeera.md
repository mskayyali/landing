## Al Jazeera Arabic Website Redesign, 2014

The Al Jazeera Arabic website redesign marked a complete transformation of the network’s primary news portal. After over a decade with minimal design changes and over 1000,000 news articles, the project aimed to update the site’s visual and technical foundations to meet modern standards in news media. This overhaul was driven by the need for improved content discoverability, a streamlined user experience, and the adoption of responsive, modern web technologies. The redesigned site would support Al Jazeera’s significant daily content production and evolving user expectations for digital news.

## Al Jazeera iPad Magazine, 2013

In 2013, I led the Al Jazeera iPad Magazine project as part of Al Jazeera’s New Media and Innovation department in Doha, Qatar. My role as Product Manager and Project Lead involved overseeing the design, development, and successful delivery of Al Jazeera’s first digital magazine across iPad and Android platforms. This initiative represented a pioneering move into digital publishing within the organisation and aimed to create a responsive, visually engaging experience for Al Jazeera’s diverse audience. This project won a Webby Award in 2013 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ztxwWlURE&list=PLWeKJ75kFs5SQprtthUj7pfnaUy8kBoQL&index=105]
