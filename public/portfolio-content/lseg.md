# Investment Platform Dashboard

## Overview

As part of the London Stock Exchange Labs, I led the UX/UI design for a machine learning (ML)-based analytics feature aimed at enhancing the Market Impact model within the Order & Execution Management Software. 

The objective was to move beyond traditional parametric models to a data-driven ML approach, delivering a higher level of accuracy for institutional users. A core design focus was introducing transparency and explainability to ensure user trust, as the client base was accustomed to conventional parametric methods.
