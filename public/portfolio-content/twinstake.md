# Institutional Staking Portal

## Overview

Twinstake is a non-custodial staking provider designed and built in collaboration with leaders in the digital assets & traditional finance space.  The company handles staked assets (billions+) and I was hired to lead the product and user experience design team to build a comprehensive client portal that allows clients to dig through their staked assets along with the data associated with it and become a destination for all future features.

Led the complete design of a self-serving portal for clients to view their staked assets, rewards, generate reports and get deep insights into their operations.

## Using
- Figma 
- Shadcn 
- Cursor IDE

## Challenge

- Providing daily and monthly data (manualy) to clients was inscreasing, becoming an operational challenge.
- No existing portal nor a design system

## Solution

- Led design workshops and user research (customers) with product and engineering to structure the portal into two simple sections: Portfolio & Insights 
- Analysed operations to provide direct points of access to different portal functionalities
- Built the design system from the ground up (using ShadCN)
- Utilised AI to design a functional prototype (in code) for the different sections, flows, and interactions.
