# Invetsment Offers Creation & Adminisitration Platform

## Overview

In 2023, I led the design for an internal platform at PrimaryBid focused on supporting Capital Markets, Operations, and Settlements teams in efficiently managing investment offers. 

This platform provided streamlined tools for offer creation, allocation, and settlements. I collaborated closely with stakeholders and technical teams, guiding the design process from initial mapping of business workflows to the final visual interface, ensuring alignment with our PB Design System.
