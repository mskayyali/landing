# Investment Offer Application Platform

## Overview

From 2023 to 2024, I led the design for the Investment Offer Application Platform at PrimaryBid, a public-facing platform enabling users to apply for investment offers. This platform created a unique, branded website for each offer, with customisable regional flows through a modular design system. 

My responsibilities encompassed building the design system, user interfaces for both desktop and mobile, and mapping key user journeys to support seamless navigation across various application scenarios.
