## Apple Intelligence Features

### On-Device AI Processing

Comma uses **Apple Intelligence** (Apple Foundation Models) for the following features on supported devices:

- **Automatic Book Categorization**: Analyzes book content to suggest categories
- **Tag Generation**: Creates descriptive tags based on book content
- **Chapter Summaries**: Generates summaries of book chapters
- **Text Explanation**: Provides explanations of selected text passages

### Privacy Guarantees

✅ **All AI processing happens entirely on your device**  
✅ **No data is sent to external servers or cloud services**  
✅ **Apple Intelligence operates locally using on-device models**  
✅ **Your book content never leaves your device**  
✅ **Summaries and explanations are generated privately**

### Device Requirements

Apple Intelligence features require:
- iOS 18.2 or later
- Compatible device (iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or later, iPad with M1 chip or later)
- Apple Intelligence enabled in Settings

**Note:** If your device doesn't support Apple Intelligence, Comma still works perfectly. You simply won't see AI-powered features like automatic categorization or chapter summaries.
